### Project: Open-source RAG for Japanese LLM in low-resource settings

Generative AI for all - Quick implementation with an open-source RAG LlamaIndex and Japanese LLM from ELYZA, Inc. in a low-resource environment over legal documents:
- RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) is LlamaIndex with a vanilla Hybrid search (combining retrieval from both text search and vector search)
- Japanese LLM (large language model) “ELYZA-japanese-Llama-2-7b-instruct” created by Japanese startup, ELYZA, Inc.
- Open-source database PostgreSQL transformed into a vector database by the great library PG Vector
Plus Q&A analysis in Japanese, embedding pricing war, and generative AI strategy of France, USA, and Japan.
