Generative AI for all - Quick implementation with an open-source RAG LlamaIndex and Japanese LLM from ELYZA, Inc. in a low-resource environment over legal documents:
- RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) is LlamaIndex with a vanilla Hybrid search (combining retrieval from both text search and vector search)
- Japanese LLM (large language model) “ELYZA-japanese-Llama-2-7b-instruct” created by Japanese startup, ELYZA, Inc.
- Open-source database PostgreSQL transformed into a vector database by the great library PG Vector
Plus Q&A analysis in Japanese, embedding pricing war, and generative AI strategy of France, USA, and Japan. 

## 💎 [A fine-tuned XLM-Roberta model for NER in the fashion and luxury industry](https://huggingface.co/AkimfromParis/NER-Luxury)
NER-Luxury is a fine-tuned XLM-Roberta model for the subtask N.E.R (Named Entity Recognition) in English. NER-Luxury is domain-specific for the fashion and luxury industry with bespoke labels. NER-Luxury is trying to be a bridge between the aesthetic side and the quantitative side of the fashion and luxury industry.

- 38.063 sentences in English (covering the beauty, fashion, and luxury industries)
- 32 labels from companies, groups, and holdings to luxury brands, models, and magazines
- Loss: 0.3990, Accuracy: 0.9427, F1: 0.7879
